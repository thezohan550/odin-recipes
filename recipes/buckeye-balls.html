        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here's what's in buckeye balls: The peanut butter balls are made with confectioners' sugar, creamy peanut butter, unsalted butter, and vanilla extract. The coating comes together quickly with just semi-sweet chocolate chips and shortening.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups creamy peanut butter</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with waxed paper; set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, butter, and vanilla in a large bowl; mix together with your hands to form a smooth stiff dough. Shape into balls using 2 teaspoons of dough for each ball. Place on the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to coat with chocolate.</li>
            <li>Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a metal bowl over a pot of simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Remove chilled peanut butter balls from the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Insert a wooden toothpick into a ball, and dip into the melted chocolate until coated. Return to the baking sheet, chocolate-side down, and remove the toothpick.</li>
            <li>Repeat Step 5 to coat remaining balls. Refrigerate coated balls until set, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
